In this document, the app will be referred to as <i>Service</i>.
                  </p> <p>This page is used to inform users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and
                    disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                  </p> <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
                    to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
                    Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described

                    error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
                    called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app,
                    the time and date of your use of the Service and other statistics. Also, through the use of Firebase Analytics, I am collecting anonymous
                    usage data, which will help focus my future development efforts on the most used features. You can disable this behavior in the Settings page of the Service.
                  </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data that are commonly used as an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

                    to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
                    advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over
                    and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites
